# YTech

brings you to Stone Age, increasing difficulty on early game by forcing you to use primitive technology for progression.

Also, vanilla mobs like cows, pigs, sheep and chickens are replaced by their wild ancestors.

Vanilla recipes for early game items are modified, forcing tools on some blocks and adding new tools, items and blocks to help you with progression.

Currently mod covers
- Stone age
- Bronze age
- Beginning of iron age (crafting iron ingot is final step right now)
