# YTech

brings you to Stone Age, increasing difficulty on early game by forcing you to use primitive technology for progression.

Also, vanilla mobs like cows, pigs, sheep and chickens are replaced by their wild ancestors.

Vanilla recipes for early game items are modified, forcing tools on some blocks and adding new tools, items and blocks to help you with progression.

Currently mod covers
- Stone age
- Bronze age
- Beginning of iron age (crafting iron ingot is final step right now)

## Compatibility

These dependencies are optional, but highly recommended:

- The One Probe - Provides more information about in-world blocks and entities
- Just Enough Items - You can see all changed recipes

- KubeJS - Easy way to add/modify/remove YTech recipes (API described on [wiki](https://github.com/yanny7/YTech/wiki))
- EMI - You can browse all recipes

All bugs report on [GitHub](https://github.com/yanny7/ytech).

Ideas for expanding implemented ages or for next ages can be shared on [discord](https://discord.gg/HauMDpbkNN).
